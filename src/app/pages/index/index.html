  <p i18n>
    This is a simple app to browse GitHub repositories and their commits. It
    uses the GitHub API to fetch data. You can search for repositories, view
    their commits, and see the commit history. The app is built with Angular and
    uses Material Design for the UI. The source code is available on
    <a href="https://github.com/Salketer/cgm">GitHub</a>
